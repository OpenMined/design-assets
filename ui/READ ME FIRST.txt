Welcome to the OpenMined design system!

To you begin your journey, please follow the steps below:

1. Before you open Sketch files, make sure that you have following fonts installed: 
    - Rubik (Google Fonts)
    - Font Awesome (from fontawesome.com)

Without these fonts, you may experience layout issues for the basic setup of the libraries.

2. Set up "OpenMined - Core" as Sketch Library. 
The file is a foundation for elements & components - it includes, Layer & Text Styles, Shapes, Colors & Gradients.

3. Attach additional files as Libraries.
The main other Sketch library is "OpenMined - Web", you should also install this as a library for any web projects. If your project will include Charts, Device Templates or Illustrations they may be useful.

Enjoy!
