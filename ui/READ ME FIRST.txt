Welcome to Prime Design System Kit!

To you begin your journey with Prime, please follow the steps below:

1. Before you open Sketch files, make sure that you have following fonts installed: 
    - SF Pro Display
    - SF Pro Text
    - Roboto
    - Montserrat
    - 
If you do not have them download and install fonts from the following link:
    - https://developer.apple.com/fonts/
    - https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Roboto
    - https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Montserrat
    - 
Without these fonts, you may experience layout issues for the basic setup of the libraries.


2. Set up “Prime - The Core” as Sketch Library. 
The file is a foundation for Prime elements & components - it includes, Layer & Text Styles, Shapes, Colors & Gradients.


3. Attach additional Prime files as Libraries. 
If your project will include Charts, Device Templates or Illustrations they may be useful.
